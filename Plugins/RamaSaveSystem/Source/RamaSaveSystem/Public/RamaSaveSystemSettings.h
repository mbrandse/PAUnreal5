		+ Adds Support For UE4 "SaveGame" Property
		
		+ Adds Support For Actor Subcomponents With Same Property Name
		
		~~~ Important Note ~~~
		Save files that have this value true/false are incompatible, so only set this to true if you don't need to be able to load old save files / have your users load old save file data.
		
		Setting this value to true adds the new features listed above!
		
		~~~ Overview ~~~
		In my original implementation any properties of the owning Actor or other components HAD to be put in a string variable list.
		
		Now with the new setup you have the option to simply mark any properties you want to save with UE4's SaveGame meta data in C++ or the property tag in Blueprints.
		
		If your project was using both my save system and UE4's save system, you will probably want to revert to the old behavior by setting this to false.
		
		~~~ Saving Several Subcomponents of Actor that share a property with the same Name ~~~
		
		If you have several subcomponents of an actor that had the same exact property name like "Location" or "Health", you can now save these same-name vars per-component with this new setup!
		
		~~~ How to Use ~~~
		You can easily save subcomponent properties of an actor where several components have a property with the same name by setting the SaveGame flag on the relevant properties, or by adding Pre-existing properties to the RamaSave_ComponentVarsToSave list :)
